### figments

a figment is made up. figments don't exist until you need them to.

figments exist in the Table of Nonexistence, a 8x8 grid for instructions.
the Table of Nonexistence holds instructions, determining how they interact with the registers of Reality. the Table
 specifies two registers to 

running a figment brings it into the world of Reality. this can be done using the instructions
- `bruh` or
- `b r u h`

the `b r u h` instruction performs the same thing as the `bruh` instruction, but the extra strength wipes the figment
 from memory, erasing it forever from the Table of Nonexistence, and Reality as well.
 
### reality of figments

when a figment is run, it leaves behind a trace of itself in the form of its "reality". a figment's reality is a
 value, which is either 1 (real) or 0 (fake). this can be detected by the instruction `what wait why where when how
 ` and handled by `seems fake but ok?` and `elsewise` (see Section using instructions).

### figment instructions

the instructions that can be used inside figments are
- `i'm DONE`: set the figment's reality value to 0 and remove the figment from Reality (end execution)
- `someone send help`: set the figment's reality value to 1 and remove the figment from Reality (end execution)
- `i'm Learning`: two registers move towards the bliss of Nonexistence. adds one to the value of both registers
 specified by the Table of Nonexistence. if the instruction
 is along the diagonal of the Table, the value of that register is increased by 2
- `i'm Struggling`: a struggle for power between two registers. adds one to the value of the first register specified
 and subtracts one from the value of the
 second register specified. if the instruction is along the diagonal of the Table, the value of that register is
  unchanged
- `nO`: warps the first register into Nonexistence (sets it to 0), and forces the second register to transcend
 Reality, changing its value into its additive inverse
- `ugh...h`: channels the inner frustration of Reality into the first register (sets the first register to the number
 of `h`s in the instruction)
- `uGH...H`: channels the inner frustration of Nonexistence into the first register (sets the first register to
 negative the number of `H`s in the instruction)

### using instructions
Every valid program starts with the line `i'm Coding!`.
